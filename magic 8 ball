# Magic 8 ball

# This is a program that will simulate a magic eight ball. The program will
# consist of two functions/methods, one for the main program which will consist
# of a while loop to prompt the user for questions, and the other method will
# consist of the code to print out the answer of the magic 8 ball to the user.
